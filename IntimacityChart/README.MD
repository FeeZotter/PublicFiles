created this because of https://www.reddit.com/r/aaaaaaacccccccce/comments/vnu361/comment/ieac606/ <br>

With the files in here you can show what you like and dont like <br>
The main idea is to show other persons, like your partner, what you like and dislike (touching stuff like pats)<br>
<br>
the empty one you could use for any topic (food, games, movies, discussion topics)<br>
<br>
In comparison to the original one i used 2 sliders, like sliders more<br>
Feel free to change it as you like<br>
<br>
Have fun and a nice day<br>

additional Informations <br>

did this on the open document format (odt) because a lot supports it (it is free, so why not) <br>
edited with open office writer <br>
libre should be better <br>
was to lazy to install it <br>

And Word is not save <br>
there is a voulnerability out there where you only open a folder with a (from a hacker) contaminated file and your computer is hacked <br>
ONLY OPENED THE FOLDER, NOT THE FILE
