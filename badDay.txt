cant really say it was either scary or really outdoors but i tell it anyway (extended edition):    
over the last week i did not nearly ate and drink enough, especcially since wednesday.    
on saturday a message popped up in the family chat about my granddads birthday so i showered quickly and left with only 3 slices of pure bread at like 14:30, so over half of the day passed already.     
The first part of my journey was without problems but when i switched from the underground train to the city train the problems started.    

After like 20 seconds my view started to get black (~80%) while i was leaning on a wall so i waited a moment for it to get better and looked for a seat.   
(a black vision is when black dots show up on your view that make it difficult to navigate, in my case it is less a big dod more like a lot evenly spread. And it is a huge indicator that your body hates your dehydration)       
Quickly i found one and as i sat down my vision got better, but i still noticed that it was not good.    
I knew that i need to leave at the second station so i thought i hold it out.      
While i was sitting the problem with the vision got worse and worse over time but more in phases from loke 10% to 0% to 12% and so on.    
I got the plan that instead of going to my granddad first i buy a drink at the station, even that i know the way is only like 3 minutes.    
The train arrived at my station so i stand up and reached for a handle/pole/thingy.       

After what felt not even like the blink of an eye i looked at 3 woman above me.      
I was very confused because it really felt for my brain like the time did flow continuous but obviously it got seperated by my blackout.    
They helped me to sit and gave me a bottle with water.    
After a few sips i often made some pauses and they sayd that i have to drink more so i followed their orders and drank more.     

We left the next station.    
At least two of the woman accompanied me, i dont know about the third one but i know a third one was out there too, so it is likely.   
On my way to the bench my bods to threw up but i managed zo keep the new aquired water.   
One of the helpers noticed it and sayd i should when my body wants it.    
So after sitting down i did and because i left my hand in front of the mouth, for the pukingnstopping before, i puked over it.        
I felt dumb while the others pulled out some wet tissues and helped me clean my hand.     

After it we made a plan what to do next.     
With the few sips i feeled a lot better so i mainly wanted to still go to the birthday in the garden because it was near, i would not be alone and i thought to go to the hospital was too extreme for me basically needing food and hydration.     
After what feelt like me convincing them why it is a good idea i called my mom to pick me up from the station i missed before, she sended my sister (later referenced as F2) with some water.     
I made my way with two of them to the other platform to drive back.       
We took the lifts that where a lot cleaner of what i would expect.     
We exchanged our names and i dont know where they where going but they told to have enough time and if something like this happens to them they would hope for that kind of support too.       
They where really very nice and helpful and kind. I hope to meet them in the future to thank them again, i even remembered their names despite me being an absolut hopeless person when it comes to it.     
As we arrived at the other side our train arrived perfectly and we entered the train.      

It was full enough that most people decided to stand instead of looking for a seat even though a few where free.    
The next "free" seat was aquired of the bag of another woman.      
On of my helpers was asking if she could free the seat.   
"No"      
"But she had a blackout"      
"would say the same"      
But then she freed the seat and i sit down, maybe more because it started getting attention from other guests.      
My helpers confronted her about her bad behavior with sentences like "at least the bag has it good".     
I dont know for what but one of the responses where "i did not see that she had a blackout"     
I tried to interfere and told that the blackout was in another train. After it the talk was pretty fast over what i thought was good.      

Next station arrived so we left the train. In search for F2 we leaved the platform and found her relativly fast and easy. My kind helpers explained what happened, that with the woman too and i mostly added maybe a few details.     
F2 was smart enough to ask for the duration of the blackout, they sayd it was like 5-10 seconds so the fall and maybe a bit more.
We shortly after parted our ways after F2 and me thanked them a lot.     

The way was mostly F2 asking me if she can support me in any way while i sipped on the cup of water she did bring me.      

As i arrived i greeted all the family members and lay down on a "flat garden seat".    
I got better as the time was going on. I got a vegetable broth that i drank over time.      
The water cup was one with straw and top part so nothing really spilled as my nephey stole it from time to time.    
My mother-sister (F3) have it every time back after he did put it somewhere.      
I mostly slept to regain energy or at least waste as little as possible.    

Now starts the dangerous part:      
My granddad asked me if i want my grilled cheese i requested a while back.     
Almost immediantly i was up, at least as fast as my drained body allowed.      
At first i was too dumb to find it in the refridgerator but after granddad came i quickly choosed between the 2 kinds they had.     
I sat down again. In the time i waited i am sure that the nephey stole my cup again.     

Then i got my cheese amd ate it between two bread slices.       
(a serious problem because fats drain more energy first before giving anything back. A lot of books have a part where people that have hungered die because the food they ate was too much for the body and drained them even more)      
After a few minutes my dizziness got stronger and it improved with time.      
I dont really know how it came to it but i switched my seat for a blanked on the grass under a pavilion.     
A good desition because i puked again, this time on the grass.    

My mom tried her best to put it with kitchen towels in a bucket and i got another bucked.     
All the time F2 invested a lot time in reaching out for me and chatting with a friend who works in the medical field for help.    
Now every time i moved to much, like turnung on my back, or drank like a sip of water i puked again.     
I really could not do anything and at some point i asked my mom if she can inform my long distance bf about what is going on and that she should boint out that a lot of people around me are taking care.     
So even that i could not do by myself.     
My body felt cold even that i knew the weather was warm so i got another blanked. At some time it started to rain what i definetly liked more than the horrible warmth.      
It got worse over time so that i feared to move or to drink more than 3 drops of water over less than 10 minutes.     
My body was at its end.      

After ~5 hours since i arrived it was clear that i need to go to a hospital.     
F2 leaved us to get a renting car while my mom helped me stand up and have me a joghurt bottle for when i need to puke again.     
Because i did not really drink anything before i managed to get pukeless to the street.           
I had not the power to stand the ~minute of waiting and sat on the streetborder.      
I got some a little bit wet towel as a blanked i could keep on me like a blanked.

The drive was harsh, every time F2 stepped even a little bit on the break it felt like i got thrown around. Bad enough that i puked one time with my empty belly.       
She was sorry for it.      
She told that newer cars have rougher breakes and because it is a rent car she never drove it before either.     

We arrived at the hospital but a little far away because she did not know if it is okay to put the car down more near the hospital.     
The first metres i did go alone because i wanted as little time as possible wasted while F2 got the bags.     
After she catched up she helped me walk.      
~100 metres later we arived at the emergency entry.    
F2 grasped fast where to go and shortly after i sat down in a recipents(?) room on the only chair with my head on the counter while F2 explained shortly what happened.     
Like immediantly the woman behind the counter (yes, like everyone was female, me included) called another person to take care of me.      

F2 brought me around a corner and then had to leave me alone because she was not allowed in that area.    
She took the still wet towel too.     
The doctor helper brought a moving bed but i had to wait for a bit until it got a sheet.      
After i hopped on it i got moved into a room where first they took blood from me for some tests.    
I sleeped before getting the infusion with water and stuff.      

I woken up, checked on my phone F2 left for me and realised it is 1:30 so i checked the notifications and put me to sleep again.     
I feelt already a lot better by the time.    
I feared a little bit what i should do because i assumed my sister left with only leaving my phone and not my train ticket that is still in my bag.     
Because the room was without windows i had no other way of knowing the time.     

Later at like 5 i woke up again, checked the phone and had to piss.     
Another patient loud or at least near enough that i can hear it talked something about the piss test so i was not sure if i should wait for a doctor and ask, BUT i really needed to pee and i didi not know when one would come so i left shortly.     
I tried to walk slowly and even that i felt powerless i did seel safe enough to walk.      

~5 Minutes after i got back the doctor came, again female, and checked my status.       
She said that my sister did wait the whole night for me. Like 8 hours.     
After the talk i waited to get the report about my visit and some medics for the next few days.     
Then i was free to go.     

I got my phone and looked for the exit and first walked in the wrong direction before i asked for help.     
In the waiting zone i found my sister sitting an a chair.     

For most of the day i stayed by my sister until i really was sure that nothing bad happens anymore.       
That could have gone a lot worse on like every point and only because of the help i am now in a good state again.

And i had a not bleeding wound on my shoulder from my fall in the train but that only really impacted me lay down because it was on my favorite side to lean to.       


So: **stay hydrated**
